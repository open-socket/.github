# Open-Socket

**Open-Socket** is an open-source initiative aimed at creating a vendor-agnostic, multi-platform API for socket-based real-time communication. Our goal is to provide developers with the ability to easily switch between different socket providers (such as Ably, Socket.IO, and Pusher) without locking themselves into a single solution.

## Mission
Our mission is to simplify socket communication for developers by offering a unified API and SDKs for various platforms and languages, making real-time features easier to integrate, maintain, and extend.

## Repositories
We are currently working on the following repositories:

- **core**: The foundational repository for Open-Socket, providing the vendor-agnostic API.
- **node-sdk**: The Node.js SDK for integrating the core library into Node.js applications.
- **react-sdk**: A React SDK for web-based real-time applications.
- **python-sdk**: Python SDK for integrating with Python frameworks.
- **php-sdk**: PHP SDK for PHP-based applications.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from developers of all levels! Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved.
