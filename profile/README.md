# Open-Socket

**Open-Socket** is an open-source initiative that aims to create a unified, vendor-agnostic API for real-time socket communication. By using Open-Socket, developers can switch between socket providers (like Ably, Socket.IO, and others) with ease, without being locked into a specific vendor.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to enable seamless socket communication across various platforms, making it simple for developers to integrate real-time functionality in their applications, regardless of the underlying provider.

## Organization Repositories
We are in the process of building the following core repositories:

- **core**: The foundational library that abstracts socket providers.
- **node-sdk**: Node.js SDK for integrating Open-Socket in server-side applications.
- **react-sdk**: React SDK for integrating Open-Socket in web applications.
- **python-sdk**: Python SDK for integrating Open-Socket with Python-based frameworks.
- **php-sdk**: PHP SDK for integrating Open-Socket into PHP web projects.
  
More SDKs and platform integrations are planned as part of our roadmap.

## Contributions
We welcome contributions from the community! Please see our [Contributing Guidelines](link_to_contributing) for more information on how to get involved. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or join the discussion on GitHub.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Develop the core library.
- **Phase 2**: Build SDKs for Node.js, React, Python, and PHP.
- **Phase 3**: Expand support to additional platforms and socket providers.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
